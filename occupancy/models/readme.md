## Models
This folder contains models used when interacting with IoT Spaces management apis.

These models are not complete (do not contain all fields available).  See the Swagger documentation that is part of your IoT Spaces instance for a complete description.  Also see `TODO: enter link` for how you can generate typescript models from that documentation using AutoRest.  With those, you can replace these models.
